This is the official version 3 branch.

The readme will be updated when it's time to write a proper readme.

Directory Guide (for people who aren't the best at mentally parsing nested folders):

- `shared/src` is where the main Scala source code is.
- `shared/src/main/scala` is where the interpreter files are.
- `shared/src/test/scala` is where the test files are
- `jvm/src/main/scala` is where the entry file for the command line is. It's the `__main__.py` of the project in a sort of a way.
