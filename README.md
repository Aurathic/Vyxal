# What is this No Bugs branch?

The code clean up made everything a big mess. That isn't anyone's fault. The code just wasn't suited to such a big change.

This is our chance to make things right - to guarantee a version of Vyxal in a way that is clean, maintainable and free of bugs.

As long as we make sure not to have any problematic things like "code" or "functionality", we can ensure that this version of Vyxal will have no bugs, no problems, and no heartache.
