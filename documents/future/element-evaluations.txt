hyper-neutrino's evaluations on existing elements

mostly considering how often they'll be used, how easily replaceable they are by
other things, and if I feel that they are really necessary to keep around.

I recommend removing the following:
- × (Asterisk Literal) - it just seems kind of pointless and overspecialized TBH, just use \*
- ¤ (Empty String) - just doesn't seem all that valuable, just use ``
- is ċ (Not One) that useful?
- is ₂ (Is Even) that useful when parity exists?
- is ₃ (Divisible By three) even useful besides FizzBuzz?
- is ₅ (Divisible By Five) even useful besides FizzBuzz?
- ǒ (Modulo 3) - is this needed


I'm not too sure if the following are that important/needed:
- « (Base Compressed String)
- some of the ranges could possibly be removed although it'll cost more bytes in some cases which might not be worth it
- I doubt triplicate is that popular but it's probably a pretty core feature to have in a stack-based language
- push -1 is potentially not all that useful but also it could probably be made obsolete with different number syntax much like how Jelly does it
- ð (Space) - could just be `\ ` so I'm not sure it warrants the byte
- ¶ (Newline) - could just be \[NL] so I'm not sure it warrants the byte
- if the register is not popular you could free some bytes by just deleting it
- is the global array used much?
- FizzBuzz constants could be removed but I assume you don't want to
- some of the k-constants might not be all that useful but I don't think there's a need to remove them
- same goes for ∆-digraphs, the quadratic/polynomial solvers seem potentially not that useful (though they'd be really difficult to implement without built-ins so it could be useful)
- the bracketify ø-digraphs might not be necessary


I propose potential changes to the following:
- max/min by tail - could that just be max/min by key being reverse instead? I feel like that'd be more useful


Any I haven't listed here I either missed or I think they're necessary or at
least important enough that they shouldn't really be considered for deletion.
