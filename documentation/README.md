# Vyxal docs

This folder contains documentation on Vyxal. [elements.txt](./elements.txt) has all the elements.

You probably want to read the MD files on how the interpreter works in approximately this order:

1. [Lexer.md](./Lexer.md)
2. [Parser.md](./Parser.md)
3. [Interpreter.md](./Interpreter.md)
4. [Element-Impls.md](./Element-Impls.md)

If any part of the documentation is lacking (either the Markdown files here or
doc comments in the source code), please let us know (through an issue or in
chat) so we can improve it.

- [Scala for JavaScript devs](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/scala-for-javascript-devs.html)
