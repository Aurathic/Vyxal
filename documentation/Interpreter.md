The interpreter file is the main brains of the whole Vyxal project - it's where the pipeline flows to after reading all neccesary inputs (like program files) and where vyxal programs are lexed and parsed. It also handles execution of Vyxal programs, via the `execute` function. There are two overloads of the execute function:

```scala
def execute(code: String)(using ctx: Context): Unit
```

and

```scala
def execute(ast: AST)(using ctx: Context): Unit
```

The `code: String` overload of `execute` is for programss that are still in their string form. This overload takes the string, lexes and parses it, and then hands it to the `ast: AST` overload of execute.

The `ast: AST` overload of `execute` uses the [visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) pattern for executing ASTs. After parsing, the result is an `AST.Group`, which is an AST object that contains a list of `AST` objects that are executed sequentially. `AST`s are evaluated according to the following rules:

| AST Object           	| How it's Executed                                                                                                       	| Context Variable Involved?                                                                          	|
